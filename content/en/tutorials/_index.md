Use cases in multiRegionFoam demonstrate how the framework can be applied to
solve a wide range of coupled multiphysics problems. Each use case provides a
self-contained example that showcases the setup, configuration, and simulation
of interactions between multiple physical regions—such as solid–fluid,
fluid–fluid, or electrochemical domains. These cases illustrate practical
workflows, including conjugate heat transfer, multiphase interface dynamics,
compressible–incompressible coupling, and thermoelectric transport. By exploring
these examples, users gain insight into how to define region-specific solvers,
boundary interfaces, and coupling strategies, enabling them to adapt the
methodology to their own engineering or research applications efficiently and
accurately.
